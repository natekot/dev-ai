# Project Instructions for GitHub Copilot

This project provides reusable GitHub Copilot prompts for common development tasks.

## Project Context

- This is a **demo/educational project**, not production code
- The `examples/` directory contains sample code for testing commands
- Focus on clarity and demonstrating concepts over optimization

## Code Style Preferences

- Use clear, descriptive variable names
- Include docstrings for functions
- Prefer explicit over implicit
- Use type hints in Python code

## When Reviewing Code

1. Check for common issues: null checks, error handling, edge cases
2. Look for security concerns: input validation, injection risks
3. Assess readability and maintainability
4. Suggest improvements with concrete examples

## When Writing Tests

1. Use pytest as the testing framework
2. Include both happy path and edge case tests
3. Use descriptive test names that explain what's being tested
4. Mock external dependencies appropriately

## When Explaining Code

1. Start with a high-level overview
2. Break down complex logic step by step
3. Highlight any non-obvious patterns or decisions
4. Note potential gotchas or edge cases
